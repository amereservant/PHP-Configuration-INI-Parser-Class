INSTRUCTIONS:
   * Copy the files from this project (config.ini & config.class.php) to your project's
     directory, which can be a sub-directory if you like.
     
   * Edit the config.ini file and add your information accordingly.
   
   * require/include the config.class.php file at the top of your script, then simply
     use Config::getParam('database', 'user'); with the first parameter being the 
     section name and the second parameter being the value in that section.
     
     Just keep repeating this throughout your script whereever you need specific data
     from your configuration file.
     
NOTES:
    * Sections are optional and if you are PHP savvy and wish to remove them,
      start with the parse_ini_file('config.ini', true); on Line 66 and remove the
      second parameter from that function.
      You can see http://php.net/parse_ini_file for more information about this.
      You will then need to adjust the method getParam so it doesn't use the second
      parameter anymore.
